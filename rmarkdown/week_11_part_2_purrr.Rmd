# Nested tibbles

The **Tidyverse** `tibble` has another advantage over the traditional `data.frame` and that is that it can accept nested data.

You can read more about **nested data formats** in this [entry](https://tidyr.tidyverse.org/articles/nest.html) in the tidiverse. Technically is almost equivalent to a named list, but it is displayed in a table format which makes it very intuitive to use.

```{r}

nested_penguins <- penguins %>% 
  group_by(species) %>% 
  nest()

print(nested_penguins)

```

Th `data` column that was created now contains the subset datasets for each of the species.

You can see, that if we request that column, what we get is a list with three datasets.

NOTE: Please note how the variable `species` **does not** appear in these subsets, as it is its own column outside the subset data.

```{r}

nested_penguins$data

```

Using the method we already know of how to navigate data frames and lists, we can request one of those subsets if we want.

```{r}

nested_penguins$data[[1]]

```

Because the basis for this nesting is `group_by()` we get all the functionality of the function, including the ability to group by various variables at once.

If we group by species and year, we get all unique combinations of those two elements, now with their specific subsets of data as a separate column (ote that neither species, nor year are columns of the subset.)

```{r}

penguins %>% 
  group_by(species, year) %>% 
  nest()

```

# working iteratively through data with **{purrr}**

Now that we are familiar with nested tibbles, lets see what we can do with them.

## Example I - Generating multiple plots at once

For This first section we are going to use the **Palmer Penguins** data set. In particular, we are going to look at the relationship between body mass and the depth of the bill (measure of the beak). 
Let's take a look at how this relationship looks like:

```{r}

penguins %>% 
  ggplot() +
  geom_point(aes(x = body_mass_g, y = bill_depth_mm, colour = species)) +
  geom_smooth(aes(x = body_mass_g, y = bill_depth_mm, colour = species), method = "lm")

```

What if we wanted to have individual figures for each of the species?

We could create a panel with `facet_wrap()` as we have already seen...

```{r}

penguins %>% 
  ggplot() +
  facet_wrap(~species) +
  geom_point(aes(x = body_mass_g, y = bill_depth_mm, colour = species)) +
  geom_smooth(aes(x = body_mass_g, y = bill_depth_mm, colour = species), method = "lm")

```

but what is we actually wanted **individual** files for each species? would we need to create them one by one?

**Spoiler**: no, you do not have to make them one by one! that would be a pain with three species, but just impossible if we had hundreds!

Fortunately, the function `purrr::map()` is a very powerful function that allows us to iterate through the rows of a tibble and use information contained in one (or several) of the columns to apply some calculation or function (e.g. making a plot). 

Generally it gets applied as part of a `mutate()` so the output can become a new column.

```{r}

nested_plots <- penguins %>% 
  group_by(species) %>% 
  nest() %>% 
  mutate(plot = map(.x = data,        # in map() the ".x = " allows us to indicate the column that we want to iterate through (in this case the "data" column)
                    ~ ggplot() +      # now we tell map() what do we want to do with that data. for that we use the "~"
                      geom_point(data = .x, aes(x = body_mass_g, y = bill_depth_mm)) +   # Remember we are not downstream of a pipe, so we need to specify the data
                      geom_smooth(data = .x, aes(x = body_mass_g, y = bill_depth_mm), method = "lm")
                    )
         )

print(nested_plots)

```

We get a new column (`plot`) which holds the ggplot objects (i.e. the plots). We can use the approaches that we already know to "dig" through this dataset and grab the parts that we want:

```{r}

nested_plots$plot[[2]]

```

We do have a small problem, though, there is no information in the figure as to what species the figure is about!

How would we go about adding that information to the figure?

The function `map2()` allow us to reference **2 column**s of the nested tibble to be used in the iteration.

```{r}

nested_plots_2 <- penguins %>% 
  group_by(species) %>% 
  nest() %>% 
  mutate(plot = map2(.x = species, .y = data,   # Now we need to reference two columns, one as ".x" and the other as ".y"
                     ~ ggplot() +
                       geom_point(data = .y, aes(x = body_mass_g, y = bill_depth_mm)) +
                       geom_smooth(data = .y, aes(x = body_mass_g, y = bill_depth_mm), method = "lm") +
                       labs(title = .x)
                     )
         )

print(nested_plots_2)

```
Now you can see that the figure proudly displays the name of the species.

```{r}

nested_plots_2$plot[[1]]

```

What if we wanted to use information contained in **more than 2 columns**?

The function `pmap()` allows us to use information from *n* columns by providing a **list of columns**, then the different columns can be called based on their **position** in that list.

Because this is the most flexible version and the referencing of elements is more straight forward, **i would recommend you use this one** even when you only need data from one or two columns)

```{r}

nested_plots_3 <- penguins %>% 
  group_by(species, year) %>% # in this case, i am going to nest the data by species and year
  nest() %>% 
  mutate(plot = pmap(list(species, year, data), # now we provide a list of columns
                     ~ ggplot() +
                       geom_point(data = ..3, aes(x = body_mass_g, y = bill_depth_mm)) +
                       geom_smooth(data = ..3, aes(x = body_mass_g, y = bill_depth_mm), method = "lm") +
                       labs(title = str_c(..1, ..2, sep = " - "))
                     )
         )

print(nested_plots_3)

```
Now the figure shows the species name and the year!

```{r}

nested_plots_3$plot[[1]]

```

Now... what if we wanted to save all these figures? would we need to do it one by one, or could we do it all at once?

Yeah, you guessed it, you can do it all at once!

We invoke `purrr::pmap()` when we want to modify or create a column with a new object or data. The related function `purrr::pwalk()` can be called when what we want is not a new or modified column but the *side effects* of a function (e.g. to save a plot)

So we can use `pwalk()` to iterate through the plots and apply `ggsave` to each of them. But before we need a couple of steps to make it easy for `pwalk()` to have all the info it needs.

Lets create a column called `filename` where we will use the 


```{r}

nested_plots_3 <- penguins %>% 
  group_by(species, year) %>% # in this case, i am going to nest the data by species and year
  nest() %>% 
  mutate(plot = pmap(list(species, year, data), # now we provide a list of columns
                    ~ ggplot() +
                      geom_point(data = ..3, aes(x = body_mass_g, y = bill_depth_mm)) +
                      geom_smooth(data = ..3, aes(x = body_mass_g, y = bill_depth_mm), method = "lm") +
                      labs(title = str_c(..1, ..2, sep = " - "))
                    ),
         filename = str_c(species, year, "plot.pdf", sep = "_")
         )


print(nested_plots_3)

```

Now, to make it ieven easier for `pwalk()` we are just going to keep the two colums we want: `plot` and `filename`

```{r}

nested_plots_3b <- nested_plots_3 %>% 
  select(filename, plot)

```

hummmm... that didn't do what i wanted! I wanted to show this behaviour because you might encounter it in the future. If you have a grouped tibble, (i.e. you have applied `grou_by()` to it), it will force you to keep the columns you are grouping by. If you want to get rid of those columns, you need to use `ungrou()` first.

```{r}

nested_plots_3b <- nested_plots_3 %>% 
  ungroup() %>% 
  select(filename, plot)

```

now that we have just the plot and its filename, we can apply `pmap()`

```{r}

pwalk(nested_plots_3b,           # what we want to walk through
      ggsave,                    # what we want to do as we walk through the object   
      path =  here("figures"),   # where we want to save it
      width = 190, height = 120, units = "mm") # other things you need for ggsave

```


# Example II - Applying models to data subsets

**DISCLAIMER**: This is not a stats course! I am going to show you how to bulk run a bunch of linear models at once. With great power comes great responsibility. Just because you can fit hundred's of models in one go it does not means it is appropriate to do so in every case. Review your stats knowledge to see how you can incorporate steps related to checking assumptions and assessing what models to fit. Make sure that what you are doing is appropriate!

```{r}

penguins_models <- penguins %>% 
  group_by(species, year) %>% 
  nest() %>% 
  mutate(model = pmap(list(data),
                      ~ lm(bill_depth_mm ~ body_mass_g, data = ..1 )
                      )
         )

```

Just like before, we can inspect any of these model objects

```{r}

penguins_models$model[[1]]

```

And because they are `lm()` objects, just like the ones we saw in the first section of the class, we can apply `broom` tools to them

For example, we can tidy the model output with `tidy()`

```{r}

tidy(penguins_models$model[[1]])

```

Or we can check for the summary of important stats with `glance()`

```{r}

glance(penguins_models$model[[1]])

```

Using what we know about "digging" through objects, we can extract specific values, like the slope:

```{r}

tidy(penguins_models$model[[1]])$estimate[2]

```

If we put it all toguether, we can create a new column to store any of these pieces of information that we'd like to keep:

```{r}

penguins_models %>% 
  mutate(intercept = pmap(list(model),
                         ~ tidy(..1)$estimate[2])
         )

```

Unfortunately that is not very visual. Lucky for us all the `map()` functions have speciffic versions where you can request the output to be of a particular kind.

In this case, we can call `map_dbl()` to request that the output be a double.

```{r}

penguins_models %>% 
  mutate(intercept = pmap_dbl(list(model),
                         ~ tidy(..1)$estimate[2])
         )

```


Still, not very visual, so lets ad some rounding


```{r}

penguins_models %>% 
  mutate(intercept = map_dbl(.x = model,
                         ~ round(tidy(.x)$estimate[2], digits = 3)
                         )
         )

```

Now we can do the same for other important parameters.

```{r}

penguins_models_and_results <- penguins_models %>% 
  mutate(intercept = pmap_dbl(list(model),
                             ~ round(tidy(..1)$estimate[2], digits = 3)),
         slope = pmap_dbl(list(model),
                         ~ round(tidy(..1)$estimate[1], digits = 3)),
         r_squared = map_dbl(.x = model,
                             ~ round(glance(.x)$r.squared, digits = 3)),
         p_value = map_dbl(.x = model,
                             ~ round(glance(.x)$p.value, digits = 3)),
         test = str_c(species, year, sep = "_")
         
  )

print(penguins_models_and_results)

```

And now we can pretty-it-up, and we get a nice summary table of 9 different lm fits. 

I hope you realize the power of this aproach... Sure you could have done the 9 modles individually... but think that it would have taken you exactly the same effort to fit several hundred models at once!

```{r}

penguins_models_and_results %>% 
  ungroup() %>% 
  select(-data, -model) %>% 
  gt(groupname_col = "species")

```


## Example III - Using purrr to load multiple files at once

The approach we are going to take is to create a tibble with a column named `files` where we will list the address of all files contained in our target folder (in this case the `data` folder).

After that, we will use `map()` to iterate through that list and read each of the files, then we will bind the rows to have one single file.

```{r}

combined_data <- tibble(files = fs::dir_ls(here("data"))) %>%  # we create a tibble of files in that folder. Remember we are in an .Rmd file, so we need to use here()
  mutate(data = pmap(list(files), 
                     ~ read_csv(..1, col_names = TRUE))) %>%  # We load each individual file as a tibble-within-a-tibble
  select(data) %>% # select only the actual data tibbles
  map_df(bind_rows) %>%  # bind them all into one tibble
  clean_names() # clean the column names

print(combined_data)

```

What if we wanted to keep important information stored in the file name (e.g. the batch number in this case)?

```{r}

combined_data <- tibble(files = fs::dir_ls(here("data"))) %>%  # we create a tibble of files in that folder
  mutate(data = pmap(list(files), 
                     ~ read_csv(..1, col_names = TRUE))) %>%  # We load each individual file as a tibble-within-a-tibble
  mutate(data = pmap(list(files, data), 
                     ~ mutate(..2, source_file = as.character(..1)))) %>% # To each individual dataset we add the name of the file it came from (for reference)
  select(data) %>% # select only the actual data tibbles
  map_df(bind_rows) %>%  # bind them all into one tibble
  clean_names() # clean the column names

print(combined_data)

```

Now we can use what we know of working with strings to get the batch numbe rinto its own column.

```{r}

combined_data %>% 
  mutate(batch = stringr::str_extract(source_file, "(?<=Batch_)[:digit:]{1}")) %>% # extract the date using regex
  select(-source_file) # we dont need it anymore

```
